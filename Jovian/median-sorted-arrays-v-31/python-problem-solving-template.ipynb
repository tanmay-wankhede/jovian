    "Since the median splits the merged list in half, we know that the summed up lengths of left parts differ by 0 or 1 (depending on the fact that `m` + `n` can be odd or even) from the summed up lengths of right parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use binary search to look for the positions that split the `nums1` and `nums2` lists into their left and right parts, so that every element in the left parts is smaller or equal to every element in right parts. We look mainly for two indices: `pos_nums1` and `pos_nums2` (position where we split the list). Summing them up gives us a position that would be in the middle of a merged list `(m + n) // 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we want to keep the lengths of both parts so that they resemble a division made by a median, we look only for `pos_nums1` position, while calculating the `pos_nums2` from the knowledge about the length of resulting array. So `pos_nums2 = (m + n + 1) // 2 - pos_nums1`. We add 1 because we want to make sure that the left side is always the one that has an extra element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing `pos_nums1` and `pos_nums2` we know elements that would be to the left and right of the median. We define them like this:\n",
    "- `eL1 = nums1[pos_nums1 - 1]` if `pos_nums1` > 0 else we just use a global minimum (because there's no element to the left of 0)\n",
    "- `eR1 = nums1[pos_nums1]` if `pos_nums1` < `m` else we just use a global maximum (because there's no element to the right of `m`\n",

    "- `eR2 = nums2[pos_nums2]`if `pos_nums2` < `n` else we just use a global maximum (because there's no element to the right of `n`\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the \"left\" parts smaller or equal to median, and \"right\" parts bigger or equal to median, we have to make sure that:\n",
    "- `eL1 <= eR1` - this condition is always fulfilled as we split the initially sorted list\n",
    "- `eL2 <= eR2` - same as above\n",
    "- `eL1 <= eR2` - this condition makes sures that both left parts (resulting from splitting `nums1` and `nums2`) are to the left of the median\n",
    "- `eL2 <= eR1` - same as above\n",
    "\n",
    "First two conditions are always true because the lists are sorted. The last two define moment where we stop binary searching the positions, because we've already know partitioning of both list, such that all elements on the left are smaller or equal to all elements on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the median after finding the positions, we use defined earlier elements `eL1`, `eL2`, `eR1` and `eR2`.\n",
    "If `m` + `n` is odd, then the left part is one element longer. We take median as max of `eL1` and `eL2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case differs if it's even, because there are two middle elements. But it's easy to find them. We again look for maximum value of `eL1` and `eL2` - this is because the larger of those elements would be closer to the median after actual merging. We also calculate minimum value of `eR1` and `eR2` - again, minimum of those values would be closer to the median. After finding them, we just calculate their average:\n",
    "`(max(eL1, eL2) + min(eR1, eR2))/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has `O(log(min(m, n))` complexity, because we binary search for the position of the shorter of lists only."
